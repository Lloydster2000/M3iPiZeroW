# M3iPiZeroW
At this pont this repo is to dabble in translating Keiser M3i broadcasts into Bluetooth smart services useful for  use with training software.  Other folks are doing this (see hypermoose/Keiser2Zwift and ptx2/gymnasticon).  My goal is to setup a headless PI Zero W with no additional dongles to read M3i braodcasts and implement the BLE services for
Cycling Power (including cadence info)
Cycling Speed and Cadence (only cadence info)
Fitness Machine (power, instantaneous cadence, heart rate)
Heart Rate

I'll be learning how to use github and node.js at that same time, so likely will be a bit muddled for awhile!
